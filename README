Introduction
------------

First came the Arduino, then came the SimpleCortex for when the Arduino is to wimpy, now comes the NeoCortex Alice, for when the SimpleCortex is to wimpy. Why NeoCortex? Because the NeoCortex is based on the STM32F407VG6 ARM Cortex-M4 MCU. The neocortex is part of the brain, more specifically, part of the cerebral cortex, in mammals. In humans, it is involved in higher functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spacial reasoning, conscious thought and language. We think the name fits the device with such a powerful processor.

Why Alice? Alice is just a name to distinguish between different versions (If more versions follow).
